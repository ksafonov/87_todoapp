# Todoapp

Todoapp is a lightweight Django app that uses Tailwindcss.

It lets you operate with one single TODO list.
It should be able to:
- add a new entry
- check entry as Done
- Remove an entry

A Todo list item has content, created_at / marked_as_done_at.

This app does not have any notion of a User. Whoever visits it can do all the actions, there's no auth.
